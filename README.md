# Housemates

This project will use php and Laravel framework to create a web app. The app is designed to allow users to share contact information, grocery lists, calendars, and chat.
More detailed design information is available at: https://github.com/SCCapstone/CapstoneProject/wiki/Design

## Style

This project will use the [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/) style guide from the PHP Framework Interoperability Group.

## External Requirements

In order to build this project you first have to install:

* composer
* Laravel
* php
* vscode or desired IDE
* xammp
* MySQL

## Setup

User must install Laravel and Composer.<br>
The user must clone repository onto their local machine.<br>
The user must  also have xampp and MySQL installed in order to run an apache and MySQL database server locally. 

If the user would like to create a new laravel project the commands are as follows:<br>
User must install Laravel and Composer.<br>
Then the user must navigate into their Laravel folder in the command line.<br>
Next the user must type "laravel new projectName"

## Running

Developer will use command:
"php artisan serve" in command line within project vscode directory to run local server for viewing webpages

# Deployment

For deployment the user will have to contact Camryn or another member for the necessary username and password. This will give them access to the Forge account where deployment will be possible.

# Testing

The unit tests are in `/tests/Unit`.

The behavioral tests are in `/tests/Behavioral/`.

## Testing Technology

We do not plan on installing software to automate testing. We will create test users in testCase.php that will create users and run functions to check certain aspects of the web application.  

## Running Tests

We will run our tests through testCase.php. Compiling and running testCase.php will automatically run our application by using the file CreateApplication.php.
